Each player must equip any one of these gloves: Tycoon, Reaper, Killstreak, God's Hand, and bob (You can also spawn bob with Angler). Both the Killstreak and Reaper users must have at least 3 kills. The Eternal BOB portal can be summoned with only 4 players if the player using bob spawns bob on one of the players, resets, and then equips another required glove for the boss.\nOnce the players have met the requirements, the bob user needs to use their ability on any of the players. It is recommended that the player who bob is targeting is on an object such as a tree or the top of the Tycoon if it was spawned, as bob cannot reach players if they are above him. After doing all of that, every player involved must be close to the bob entity. When every single person meets these requirements, the God's Hand user must stop time. A portal will spawn, and all players except the bob user (assuming they didn't change their glove), will be sent into The Dark Realm. From there, the players must defeat The Eternal BOB, which typically takes around 45-60 minutes. Players have a total of four lives to beat the boss which can be recovered with specific Tycoon upgrades.\nOnce the majority of The Eternal BOB’s health has been depleted, the remaining teammates will have to duel with Default. The player who won the duel must defeat The Eternal BOB's final phase for everybody else to obtain rob. If they instead decide to die, they will be awarded the Clipped Wings badge, while everyone else gets nothing.",
